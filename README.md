TITLE:-

**Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System Powered by AI, Geo-Fencing, and Blockchain-based Digital ID**

DESCRIPTION:-

**This problem statement proposes the development of a Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System that leverages AI, Blockchain, and Geo-Fencing technologies. The system should include:**

• Digital Tourist ID Generation Platform

• A secure blockchain-based system that issues digital IDs to tourists at entry points (airports, hotels, check-posts).

• These IDs should include basic KYC (Aadhaar/passport), trip itinerary, and emergency contacts, and be valid only for the duration of the visit.

**Mobile Application for Tourists**

• Auto-assign a Tourist Safety Score based on travel patterns and area sensitivity.

• Geo-fencing alerts when tourists enter high-risk or restricted zones.

• Panic Button with live location sharing to nearest police unit and emergency contacts.

• Optional real-time tracking feature (opt-in) for families and law enforcement.

**AI-Based Anomaly Detection**

• Detect sudden location drop-offs, prolonged inactivity, or deviation from planned routes.

• Flag missing, silent, or distress behaviour for investigations.

**Tourism Department & Police Dashboard**

• Real-time visualizations of tourist clusters and heat maps of high-risk zones.

• Access to digital ID records, alert history, and last known locations.

• Automated E-FIR generation for missing person cases.

**Multilingual Support**

• App and platform available in 10+ Indian languages and English.

• Voice/text emergency access for elderly or disabled travellers.

**Data Privacy & Security**

• End-to-end encryption and compliance with data protection laws.

• Blockchain ensures tamper-proof identity and travel records.

**Background**

In regions like the Northeast, where tourism is a key economic driver, ensuring the safety of visitors is paramount.

Traditional policing and manual tracking methods are insufficient in remote and high-risk areas.

There is a pressing need for a smart, technology-driven solution that ensures real-time monitoring, rapid response, and secure identity verification for tourists, while maintaining privacy and ease of travel.

**Expected Solution**

A robust digital ecosystem comprising:


• Web portal and mobile app for tourists and authorities.

• AI/ML models for behaviour tracking and predictive alerts.

• Blockchain-based ID generation and verification.

• Real-time dashboards for police/tourism departments.

• Optional IoT wearable integration for enhanced safety.

• Automated alert dispatch and evidence logging systems.

**Tech Stack**

• Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS

• Backend: Node.js / Java (Spring Boot optional)

• Database: MongoDB / MySQL


• AI Models: Python (TensorFlow / PyTorch for anomaly detection)

• Geo-Fencing: Google Maps API / Leaflet.js

• Blockchain: Ethereum / Polygon (Digital ID smart contracts)

• Authentication: JWT + Blockchain verification



**System Architecture**



**Tourist App**
• Sign up using Blockchain-based Digital ID.

• AI-powered safety alerts.

• SOS button with real-time location sharing.



**Authority Dashboard**

• Visual map with tourists’ geofenced boundaries.


• Incident alerts with verified tourist identity.

• AI-predicted high-risk areas.



**Blockchain Layer**

• Stores immutable tourist identities.

• Ensures trusted verification without centralized control.

**Use Case Scenarios**

• A tourist enters a restricted forest area → Geo-fencing triggers an alert → Authorities notified.

• A tourist faces a medical emergency → SOS button pressed → Nearest hospital + verified ID shared.

• AI predicts crowd congestion or potential hazard zones → Preventive alerts sent to tourists & guides.


**Team Roles**

• AI & Data Modeling → Safety Monitoring

• Blockchain Developer → Digital ID Smart Contract

• Frontend Developer → Tourist Mobile/Web App

• Backend Developer → Incident Response API + DB

• UI/UX Designer → Simple & tourist-friendly interface

**Future Enhancements**

• Multilingual Support for International Tourists.

• Integration with IoT wearables for health monitoring.

• Cross-border tourist identity verification using blockchain.

• AI chatbots for real-time tourist assistance
